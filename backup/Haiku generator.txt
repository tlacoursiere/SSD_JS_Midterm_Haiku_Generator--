Create a haiku generator, that will ask the user for one word and its syllable count. You will then use that word with some random other words, but keep the correct 5-7-5 syllable structure of a haiku. You will need an array of objects. Your object will have a word you chose, and that word's syllable count. You will randomly select words, so that when I run your program multiple times, I get different haikus. The form for user entry should not be shown with the completed haiku.
